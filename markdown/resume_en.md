Education
---------

2004-2009
:   **Msc in Electronics and Communication networks**; INSA (Rennes)

2004
:   **French baccalaureate in science with high honors**, La Roche sur Yon (France)

Experience
----------

**01/2014 - 10/2014	Research Engineer CINES (Montpellier)** C.I.N.E.S. (Centre Informatique National de l’Enseignement Supérieur) is one of the three national computation centers in France.

* User support L2 of JADE cluster (267 Tflop/s, 23040 cores)
* Involved in PRACE 3IP work packages:
   - WP5 : SHAPE project (help an Irish SME doing bio-informatics adapt their algorithm to Intel MIC)
   - WP7 : Benchmark HPC applications on different clusters (BullX, CRAY,..)
   - PRACE Preparatory Access : Support researchers in the parallelization and optimization of their code

**10/2011 - 12/2013	Associate Scientist at Temasek Lab @ NUS** Temasek Lab is one of the National University of Singapore’s research institute promoting NUS-MINDEF (Minister of Defense) research collaborations.

* Improve a discontinuous Galerkin solver applied to Maxwell equations using OpenCL and StarPU
* In charge of the purchase of a GPU workstation (specifications, review of offers), software installation, and administrative responsibilities (installation of software, creation and management of user accounts, and customer care).
* Support and training for lab members on GPGPU technologies (CUDA, OpenCL)


**10/2009 - 09/2011     Research Engineer at INRIA « High Order discontinuous Galerkin methods on hybrid CPU/GPU parallel architectures »** INRIA is the French National Institute of Research in Computer Science and Automation

* Adapt an existing software developed in Fortran 77 to hybrid CPU/GPU parallel architectures. The software was a finite element solver using a discontinuous Galerkin method applied to electromagnetic Maxwell equations in time domain.  The final version was parallelized using Fortran90 + MPI + CUDA.
* Publication of results at SuperComputing 2010 (New Orleans).
* Creation of a C++ Discontinuous Galerkin library using GPUs in a numerical simulation platform called *num3sis*.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file).

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
